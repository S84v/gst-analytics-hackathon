# üöÄ GST Analytics Hackathon Project

Welcome to my project repository for the **GST Analytics Hackathon**! üéâ This repository contains all the code, documentation, and resources used to develop a predictive model aimed at solving a complex binary classification problem within the GST system.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains the main Jupyter notebook with detailed steps of the project.
<!-- - **`data/`**: Includes the dataset used for training, validation, and testing (ensure it's stored securely and complies with any data usage policies). -->
- **`src/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **`reports/`**: Generated reports and visualizations from the analysis.
- **`models/`**: Saved models and related files.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## üìä Project Overview

- **Objective**: To create a machine learning model that predicts whether a specific entity is classified as "0" or "1" based on various attributes provided in the dataset.
- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset containing 9 lakh records with 21 attributes, including anonymized and labeled data.
- **Methodology**: This involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, training different models, and evaluating them based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Tools & Technologies**: 
  - Python
  - Visual Studio Code
  - scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.
  - Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
  - Plotly.JS for visualization
  - Optuna for hyperparameter tuning

## üîç Key Features

- **Model Performance**: Evaluated using various metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC, and Confusion Matrix.
- **Innovative Approach**: Incorporates advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and model ensemble to boost performance.
- **Reproducibility**: All steps are documented and reproducible, ensuring that results can be verified by others.

   cd gst-analytics-hackathon
   ```
2. **Set up the environment:**

     Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebooks:**

    Open the notebooks in the **`notebooks/`** directory to explore the data, model development, and evaluation.

4. **Train the model:**

     Run the scripts in the **`src/`** directory to preprocess the data and train the model:

    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```
5. **Evaluate the model:**

    Use the evaluation script to check the model's performance:

    ```bash
    python src/evaluate_model.py
    ```
